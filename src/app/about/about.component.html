            The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Project Catalogue by EMBL-EBI aims to
            provide a comprehensive list of all the cellular resolution data
            generated by and available to the HCA community.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing links to the publications and the resources where the
            data is located, the catalogue allows quick access to all newly
            generated data in the HCA community, and accelerates collaboration
            in the building of the atlas.
          </p>

          <p>
            The list is curated by the HCA Data Wrangling team at EMBL-EBI, but
            is open for contribution of any suitable projects. To suggest a
            project for the catalogue which we have missed out,

            This catalogue is created for and by the HCA community and aims to
            provide quick and easy access to suitable data. Help us build a
            comprehensive catalogue by letting us know if we have missed a
            project.

            The Data wrangling team can support the inclusion of these types of
            projects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A project, which is already published and the data is available
              elsewhere
            </li>
            <li>
              A project, which is in the process of publication, and data is
              pending or needs an accession
            </li>
            <li>
              A project, which is under way, but there is no publication or data
              available yet. (The Data Wrangling team can support you in
              gathering and organising its metadata)
